This project can implement house price prediction using several machine learning models:

*   **Linear Regression:** A simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable (house price).

*   **Polynomial Regression:** An extension of linear regression that allows for non-linear relationships by adding polynomial terms to the features.

*   **Decision Tree Regression:** A tree-based model that makes predictions by recursively partitioning the feature space.

*   **Random Forest Regression:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

*   **Gradient Boosting Regression (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):**  Another powerful ensemble method that builds trees sequentially, with each tree correcting the errors of the previous ones.

*   **Other Models:** You can include other models like Support Vector Regression (SVR), Neural Networks, etc.

For each method, briefly explain its principles and any specific parameters used.
